    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

This test is appropriate because the data comes from two independent populations (applicants with 'black-sounding' versus 'white-sounding' names), and the variable of interest is the 'call' variable, which is a Bernoulli random variable where a value of 1 denotes success in getting a callback and 0 means no callback. Since this variable has values of only 0 or 1, we can count the number of successes and find the proportion of callbacks. The CLT applies because (1) the names are randomly assigned to resumes, which creates two independent samples and (2) for each group, the sample size multiplied by the proportion of successes and failures respectively (i.e. the number of successes and failures) is greater than or equal to 10, sufficient to use a normal approximation for the binomial distribution of the difference in proportions. The calculations to find the proportions in each sample are shown below."

    "The analyses from the frequentist stats approach as well as the bootstrapping approach resulted in a very small p-value. The p-value is the probability of getting a sample statistic value as extreme or more extreme than what is observed from the data, when the null hypothesis is true. Since the computed p-values from both approaches are very small, this implies that it is very unlikely to obtain, by random chance alone, a difference in the proportions of callbacks between applicants with black-sounding names versus those with white-sounding names as small as what was calculated in the data. Thus our data is very contradictory to the null hypothesis. We have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the interview callback rate for job applicants with black-sounding names is less than the callback rate for applicants with white-sounding names.  \n",

    "The frequentist 95% confidence interval was calculated using a method such that 95% of all confidence intervals capture the true (population) difference in the proportions of callbacks. The value 0 is not included in the interval we calculated. Since there is a 95% probablity that this interval captures the true difference in proportions of callbacks, and 0 is not included in the interval, there is sufficient evidence that the true difference in callback rates by race/name is not zero. The bootstrapped interval also was calculated in a similar manner and does not include 0. Furthermore, the range of probable values in both intervals (from the frequentist and bootstrapping approaches) for prop_b_success - prop_w_success are all negative. This suggests that the true rate of callbacks for applicants with black-sounding names is less than the true rate of callbacks for applicants with white-sounding names."

It means that race is one factor that has a statistically significant effect on callback rates. There could be other variables that affect callback success; individual hypothesis tests would need to be conducted on other variables of interest to determine whether they are statistically significant to callback success. In addition, some of these variables may be dependent on each other. Other measures or tests such as graphing, computing correlations or chi-squared tests for association can help determine if there is a dependence between race/name and other variables."
